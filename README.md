> text formatter and renderer for the shell

## overview

_styli.sh_ is a formatting tool for shell programs, which provides a 
collection of utility functions and tags for text styling.  
it also has the ability to render the formatted output to a file, or 
convert this output to a different format on the fly.

we [eat our own dog food][3]. that means you can delve into the code, 
and see how _styli.sh_ is used by itself to format and to render its own output.

## setup

1. include _styli.sh_ in your awesome program as a [git submodule][1], or just copy the source.
1. `source` the [formatter][2] script before evaluating program output.

## usage
